Files for the GDS exam
There are 3 jupyter notebooks. 
part1.ipynb
part2.ipynb
part3&4.ipynb
They naturally correspond to the different parts of the assignment, though there is some cross-over. Testing on the LIAR dataset is included in the part 2 file, for one.
The files required for everything to work are as follows:
995,000_rows.csv - The 3.18 GB corpus FakeNews dataset.
liar_test.tsv & liar_train.tsv & liar_valid.tst - The 3 parts of the LIAR dataset, renamed.
